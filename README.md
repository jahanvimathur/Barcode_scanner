# Barcode_scanner
This project develops an ESP32-based barcode scanner for inventory, retail, and logistics. It captures barcode data via serial input, connects to Wi-Fi, and sends data to an API via HTTP POST. LED indicators provide real-time status feedback. The challenge is ensuring reliable connectivity, accurate transmission, and user-friendly operation.
