In various applications, such as inventory management, retail, and logistics, barcode scanning is essential for efficient data processing. However, traditional barcode scanners require manual intervention to transfer data to a server or database. This project aims to develop an ESP32-based barcode scanner that can:

    Automatically capture barcode data from a serial input.
    Establish a Wi-Fi connection and handle connectivity issues dynamically.
    Transmit barcode data to a remote API server via an HTTP POST request.
    Provide real-time status feedback using LED indicators for Wi-Fi connectivity and data transmission success/failure.

The main challenge is to ensure reliable Wi-Fi connectivity, accurate barcode data transmission, and immediate feedback to users, making the system efficient and user-friendly.
